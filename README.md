# CVIP-Breast-Cancer-Prediction
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool for assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.
